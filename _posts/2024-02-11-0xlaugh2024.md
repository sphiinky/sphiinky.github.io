First i started by running zeek to get some insights about the pcap file you can check the logs generated from zeek here
I started by looking at the conn.log and knowing that from other questions that there a a brut force attack the **id.orig_h** was what to look for first 
```bash
$ cat conn.log | zeek-cut id.orig_h | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
      3 fe80::c4e0:a56c:e209:2c62
     24 fe80::c12d:e42b:a881:e5af
     65 192.168.204.1
    752 192.168.204.132
   1051 192.168.204.128
```

by looking again into conn.log with ```$ less -S conn.log``` and searching for the ```192.168.204.128``` IP I noticed that connections when that IP was **id.resp_h** it was on port 80 and http protocol, so its okey to assume that it is running a web server

inspecting the other two IPs I found they are connecting to this web server, and no thing interesting about the IPv6 IPs.
moving to the **http.log** with ```$ cat http.log | zeek-cut host uri | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | less -S``` and found this to be totally sus

and this

![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/04.png)

again from questions you know there is 2 attackers and now you have 2 IPs ```192.168.204.132``` and ```192.168.204.1```. For **Q1** the IP address of the victim is ```192.168.204.128``` 
inspecting the **http.log** you see first suspicious connection of the two IPs, ```192.168.204.132``` was the first attacker

Moving to **wireshark** and applying ```g``` as a filter and inspecting the headers of any response you get ```Apache/2.4.58 (Win64) OpenSSL/3.1.3 PHP/8.2.12``` and that is for **Q2**

**Flag** ```0xL4ugh{192.168.204.128_192.168.204.132_apache2.4.58_php8.2.12}```

![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/05.png)

Back again to the **http.log** with ```$ cat http.log | zeek-cut ts id.orig_h host uri | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
| grep "192.168.204.132" | less -S``` to see what the attacker first tried to do and it seems during enumeration he found interesting info 
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/06.png)
Following this http stream in **wireshark** with this filter ```ip.addr==192.168.204.128 and ip.addr==192.168.204.132 and http```you find this
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/07.png)

at first I though that he enumerated only two users, but that is not the case here there is a third one. Moving forward to see how the brute force was done and did he gain access with one of the or not, applying this filter ```ip.src==192.168.204.132 and http.request.method==POST``` in **wireshark** you can see many POST requests (625) but only three of them is for the **wp-login.php** 
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/08.png)

Following this http stream you see that he tried to login with 3 different users and each time he get the response **The password you entered for the username X is incorrect**, I guess this how he enumerated the third user
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/09.png)

What about the rest of the POST requests? Inspecting them you find that the attacker tried to get the methods that he can use
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/10.png)
Inspecting the next requests you find the attacker is using the **wp.getUsersBlogs**, asking ChatGPT for it: 
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/11.png)
So he was trying to brute force this way and we need to find the correct credentials he used. Inspecting the frame size of failure logins was **674** so filtering with ``` ip.addr==192.168.204.132  and http.response.code==200 and frame.len!=674``` reduce the packets to inspect, and the correct attempt was for that frame:

![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/12.png)
Tracing that packet back in **wireshark** and you find that:
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/13.png)

so the **Flag:** ```0xL4ugh{a1l4m:demomorgan:not7amoksha_demomorgan:demomorgan_xmlrpc.php}```


![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/14.png)

The attacker used tools for enumerating and brute forcing and its easy to spot them from the **User-Agent** . Applying ```ip.src==192.168.204.132 and http.request``` filter in **wireshark** :
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/15.png)
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/16.png)

Now enough with this IP and lets move to the second suspected IP.  Back to the **http.log** file and applying ```$ cat http.log | zeek-cut ts  id.orig_h uri | sort -n | grep -w "192.168.20
4.1" | less -S``` : 
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/17.png)
checking the responses for those requests in **Wireshark** you can find that they are actually executing, so the vulnerable plugin is **canto** and we have out C2 IP ```172.26.211.155```.  Googling ```canto cve wordpress``` and checking this you can know that **The Canto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4 via the 'wp_abspath' parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server** , and its **CVE-2023-3452**. The only thing missing is the plugin version, I searched for it but no clue. My friend told me may be they are using the latest vulnerable version and yea just like that it was the answer
**Flag**: ```0xL4ugh{sqlmap_WPScan_172.26.211.155_canto_3.0.4_CVE-2023-3452}```


![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/18.png)

Now lets see what the attacker tried to execute. Back to the **Wireshark** and filtering with ```ip.addr==172.26.211.155 and http```  and following each http stream you can find he first tried to get the **phpinfo()** 
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/19.png)

so this was the first function to test. After that he tries to allow for command execution via a GET request parameter called `cmd` which allowed him to execute ```whoami, ls, pslist``` , also we got the serverName/version

![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/20.png)

Also he tried to open a reverse shell on port ```1234``` 
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/21.png)
If you check the responses that was sent back to the attacker at ```192.168.204.1``` he did open a reverse shell but there was an issue
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/22.png)
So lets check that and see what was sent over that port, filtering with ```ip.addr==172.26.211.155 and tcp.port==1234``` and following the tcp stream you can find:
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/23.png)
Now we are missing only the username that was logged on during the attack, including the domain, we can get that by checking the responses that was sent back to the attacker at ```192.168.204.1``` 
![](/assets/images/posts/2024-02-11-0xlaugh/24.png)
and the **Flag** : ```0xL4ugh{phpinfo()_SimpleHTTP/0.6_desktop-2r3ar22\administrator_172.26.211.155:1234_uname}```
